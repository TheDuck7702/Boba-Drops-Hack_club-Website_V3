# Boba Drops Workshop — Sample Website

Welcome to the **Hack Club Boba Drops** workshop!  
In this session, we'll build a simple personal website that you can host online

## What This Project Is

This is a **sample website** built for the [Hack Club Boba Drops](https://boba.hackclub.com) program.  
It’s a small HTML + CSS project that introduces you to **web basics** — how to write HTML, style it with CSS, and publish it online.

The website includes:
- A **homepage** with text, links, and images
- Some **fun CSS styling**
- A **message to the world** — your personal “Hello, world!” ✨

## Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `index.html` | The main page of your site. Contains the content and structure. |
| `style.css` | The stylesheet. Controls colors, fonts, layout, and design. |
| `README.md` | This guide. Explains what the site does and how to customize it. |

## How It Works

### 1. HTML (`index.html`)
HTML is the **structure** of your webpage — it’s what tells the browser what to show.

Example:
```html
<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<p>Welcome to my Website</p>
